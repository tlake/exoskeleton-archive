## Community

If you aren't already part of the [PAX Community Discord](https://discord.gg/pax), it's worth a join! Therein you can find, of course, a **#drexoskeleton** channel, but I have it on good authority that other channels exist there too.

## Contributing

The Exo Archive is a simple static [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The source code lives in the [tlake/exoskeleton-archive](https://github.com/tlake/exoskeleton-archive/) repository, and if you're interested in helping contribute to the site (content-wise it's pretty simple, just markdown files) there's a [document](https://github.com/tlake/exoskeleton-archive/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for that.

If you have content you'd like to contribute but using git/github isn't for you, we'd still love your help!
Just get in touch with mechamoogle (contact info below).
