# Contributing

I know the site says that there's a document for contributing, and _technically_ that's what this is, but more in-depth documentation and guidelines will be coming Soonâ„¢.

In short, if you want to contribute, just open a pull request against `main` with your content and I'll get to it when able.
Content files live at `src/content/events/{name-of-event}/{file}.md`.

## Local dev setup (speedrun, macos edition)

- `brew install hugo`
- Clone/fork the repo, `cd` to repo root
- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`
- `hugo serve --source src/`
- Point your web browser to `localhost:1313`
